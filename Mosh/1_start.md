### If you taken any of my other courses before, you know that I don't waste your time with repetitive.

# What is TypeScript ?
A programming language to address shortcomings of JavaScript.

## Benefits
### Static typing
### Code completion
### Refactoring
### Shorthand notations

## Drawbacks
### Compliation: bowsers don't understand type script code
ts => Compiler => js
### Discipline in coding

# Why do we need it ?
# How is it different from JavaScript ?

# Set up environment
## node
## npm i -g typescript
## tsc -v

# First TypeScript Program
tsc index.ts

# Configure TypeScript Compiler
tsc --init

# Debug Ts
## "sourceMap": true
## launch.json
## "preLaunchTask": "tsc: build - tsconfig.json",
